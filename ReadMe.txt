Usage

You need to be on a slide to add boxes, of course!

If you have a shape already selected, the new boxes will scale (within reason) to the size of that shape and be added to the centre of that shape
If you do not have a shape selected, the new boxes will be added to the centre of your slide

Buttons have also been added to the Picture right-click menu. Simply:
1. right-click on your picture
2. press 'w' to add a white block or 
   'x' to add a semi-transparent block
